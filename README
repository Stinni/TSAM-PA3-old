Protocol communications

The client sends the following messages to the server for requests:
	- "REQUEST_GAME"
	- "REQUEST_SAYY"
	- "REQUEST_ROLL"
 	- "REQUEST_JOIN"
 	- "REQUEST_USER"
	- "REQUEST_LIST"
	- "REQUEST_WHOO"

In some requests the client sends a message along with the request, like REQUEST_USER sends the username and password following the request form.

The others do not need a message like LIST and WHOO, where the server just sends the information when the server can.

The Server response messages are:
	- "RESPONSE_GAME"
	- "RESPONSE_SAYY"
	- "RESPONSE_ROLL"
	- "RESPONSE_JOIN"
	- "RESPONSE_USER"
	- "RESPONSE_LIST"
	- "RESPONSE_WHOO"

Where the server sends the reponse and then the messages in the same message.
